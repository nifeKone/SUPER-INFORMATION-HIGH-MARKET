Heliopause


water is dripping through the walls

the blackness outside seems to be 
there is just blackness, the water seems to be black, too
but the water inside is 

it´s of no colour when it breaks through the walls
that´s all i can say

on level 3 several spambots do their work.
The bots are networks of huge server-cabinets on the deck
Huge servers with 12 pb data capacity

they
formulate mail subjects by analysing the browsing behaviour of their clients
in every server there are 250g of coltan
rare earths in the middle of 
international waters


the word daemons comes to mind

some of the bots have no internet connection

so they produce spam and pump it into a micro-intranet without any outgoing connections
a growing spam archive referring to subjects and data input thats totally
outdated
and the data input gets
somehow contaminated with the spam
narrow staircases, narrow doors,
all of a sudden


the servercluster is a totally hermetic network
spamming the hell out of itself
no monitors
no speakers
just the spam mirroring it´s own content in an endless feedback loop, accumulating itself exponentially and
corrupting the whole system
there is one empty floor, its about 150 by 500 metres
it is sloping, exactly a bit too much to walk there
and the ceiling is too low to even crawl

At the end there is a green light, maybe of a terminal
It is strange, there are computers everywhere but no interaction
is possible, no switches, no interfaces
