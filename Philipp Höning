The place shakes a little bit
After months of being here 
the first movement 

It´s definitely no 
offshore drilling rig or so
Hallways, giant hallways everywhere,
way too much space inside the
water is dripping through the walls

the blackness outside 
seems to be 
there is just blackness, 
the water seems to be black,
but the water inside is 

it´s of no colour 
when it breaks 
through the walls

that´s all I can say
on level 3 several spambots do their work.
Normally 
the botnet works 
via several computers outside, 
„outside“
„worldwide“
no words for outside anymore.
using them as zombies to foward the content.

The botnets here 
are networks of 
huge 
server-cabinets on the deck
servers 
with petabytes 
of data capacity



When there is 
0,02g Coltan 
in every kg 
of electronic equipment



There is an amount of 250g Coltan 
in every Server-Cabinet

Rare earths on international waters
water is dripping 
through the walls 
outside the 
moisture-sensitive 
spaces
they (the Bots)
formulate mail subjects 
by analysing the 
browsing behaviour 
of selected clients
the word 
daemons 
comes to mind
the word daemons comes to mind
some of the bots have 
no internet connection



so they produce spam 
and pump it into their own circuits 
which is causing
something like a spam-friction

a growing spam archive referring to 
subjects and data input 
thats totally
outdated
and the data input becomes
somehow contaminated with the spam again
the blackness outside seems 
to be
there is just blackness, but the water is

it´s of no colour 
when it breaks 
through the walls
narrow staircases, 
narrow doors,
all of a sudden

the whole servercluster is 
a totally hermetic network
spamming the hell out of itself

no monitors
no speakers

just the spam mirroring it´s own content 
in an endless 
feedback 
loop, 

accumulating 
itself exponentially and
corrupting 
the whole system


most of the bots/servers
Found some old mail-content in the printed archives

infinite
feedback mails all the time
