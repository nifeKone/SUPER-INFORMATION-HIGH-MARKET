The place shakes a little bit
After months of being here 
the first movement 

It´s definitely no 
offshore drilling rig or so
Hallways, giant hallways everywhere,
way too much space inside the
water is dripping through the walls

the blackness outside 
seems to be 
there is just blackness, 
the water seems to be black,
but the water inside is 

it´s of no colour 
when it breaks 
through the walls

that´s all I can say
on level 3 several spambots do their work.
Normally 
the botnet works 
via several computers outside, 
„outside“
„worldwide“
no words for outside anymore.
using them as zombies to foward the content.

The botnets here 
are networks of 
huge 
server-cabinets on the deck
servers 
with petabytes 
of data capacity



When there is 
0,02g Coltan 
in every kg 
of electronic equipment



There is an amount of 250g Coltan 
in every Server-Cabinet
Rare earths on international waters
Rare earths on international waters
water is dripping 
through the walls 
outside the 
moisture-sensitive 
spaces
they (the Bots)
formulate mail subjects 
by analysing the 
browsing behaviour 
of selected clients
the word 
daemons 
comes to mind
the word daemons comes to mind
some of the bots have 
no internet connection



so they produce spam 
and pump it into their own circuits 
which is causing
something like a spam-friction

a growing spam archive referring to 
subjects and data input 
thats totally
outdated
and the data input becomes
somehow contaminated with the spam again
the blackness outside seems 
to be
there is just blackness, but the water is

it´s of no colour 
when it breaks 
through the walls
narrow staircases, 
narrow doors,
all of a sudden

the whole servercluster is 
a totally hermetic network
spamming the hell out of itself

no monitors
no speakers

just the spam mirroring it´s own content 
in an endless 
feedback 
loop, 

accumulating 
itself exponentially and
corrupting 
the whole system


most of the bots/servers
Found some old mail-content in the printed archives

infinite
feedback mails all the time

Definition of daemon:
a daemon (/dimn/ or 
is a computer program that runs as a background process rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user. Traditionally, the process names of a daemon end with the letter d, for clarification that the process is, in fact, a daemon, and for differentiation between a daemon and a normal computer program. For example, syslogd is the daemon that implements the system logging facility, and

I fall asleep

I wake up, still inside the black hole
The tone makes 
me dizzy
Look up, 
there is no light, 
no up

by even darker dark

Breathing is a problem

Numbers 
are simply interchanged every second day

there is no randomness at all in the temperatures over the day.

Had a dream last night
that
the heat fluctuations 
roughly match 
the height differences of a tuscanian landscape.

Maybe this is the answer?


Crypto-Wellnes through the heat fluctuations, the body recognizes the lushness in the fluctuation on the same level it recognizes the lushness of a landscape.

after 5 months and 2 weeks 
of living on a ship/vessel/barge

inside international waters

I begin to feel boredom 
biting bits off 
every substantial 
certitude

Relevance begins to erode
If I am trapped inside this complex, 
why is it wrath
thinking about 
the Plateaus and patterns 
of temperature-regulation 
in incidnets that are not
large enough to be felt?

What if 
there are daemon-processes 
in my blood-vessels, 
induced by heavy junk-food-consumption 
in my early years 
and I experience 
a stroke behind 
the next corner 
which leaves me dead or paralysed

shut down the spambots due to overheating
a feeling
what is a demon,

if it is fluid
what is its 
boiling/freezing point?
I have 
a millisecond daydream

Go to the trashcan 
open it 
want to throw something into it 
my girlfriend says

“don´t trust the” loud and clear

One short thought 
“what should be wrong with trash?”
2 
wrong thoughts today
Blackness outside is
it is impossible 
to reach the front end 
of the vessel.
It is divided 
into two halfs 
with bridge/tunnel-Like transitions between the two segments

they just open 
every monday – wednesday 10:00 – 15:00 
			    friday – saturday 8:00 – 10:00 and 23:00 – 2:00
			    never on sundays
I was there two times and they were closed during opening hours?

so there are some
administrative processes like in a
state
with inherent
inefficiency
for whom?
for me?
maybe they want me to develop some dark desire
to the ships front end
„they“

maybe it´s never open.
There definitely are the anchor devices which keep the place chained to the ground in every weather condition

last night I woke up

maybe the vessel has moved a bit

the feeling 
of something really large 
in the middle of a nearly infinitely large ocean 
moving in very small increments

there is water inside the spambotpalace
An anomaly
The watercooling-complex is at 3°C all the time.

This is where the food stocks are kept, too.

Floor and walls are about 3°C because the cold water is 
used to keep the room temperature
 

Water is freezing 
near the walls
only Heavy Water freezes at 3,82°C

Heavy water is used to to cool cool down down nuclear reactors

The few moments looking “outside”
Made me be quite sure they don´t use solar-power

If the water is contaminated with radiation


The daemon thing
 
  stand 
on a huge rectangle, 
it becomes larger the more 
  run towards the edges

it is perfectly smooth
like glass

in the dream
   touch it it feels like a living piece of fur

  wake up inside the server room

On deck 12 there is a workshop
Full of solid metal blocks, they must weigh dozens 
of tons
2x2x2metres
A hair thin wire comes out of a huge machine, 
formed like a Computertomograph
The smell of burnt metal

The wire cuts through the metal 
like through butter
It must be loaded with at least 
5000 ampere
Or
The metal has the consistency of butter

The taste of blood on     tongue

The only metal that could be cut 
with a cold wire 
is highly radioactive
caesium

  take a step back
blackout
  wake up
the server room door is closed from the outside
somone is knocking against the door
loudly

  take a step back
blackout
  wake up
the server room door is closed from the outside
somone is knocking against the door
in a loudly manner
   open the door
No one there
since the
servercluster has been shut down, 

the currents are fluctuating

there is an overload on the electric system
induced by the brownout

brownout
brownout
brouwnout
bruwnoud
the leak is very small, 
nearly invisible, 
heavy water drips 
out of the hole.

It won´t be easy 
to fix it because 
of the coldness 
and the moisture. 
Gaffertape won´t do it.

So   cut the cables of the botnet.

  wake up.

Same situation, 
feedback loop

After cutting the cables 
of the botnet, 
the light begins 
to flicker and a flickering sound slowly begins 
to fill up the whole space.

There must be an overload because of the abrupt brownout after the separation of the botnet.

Wake up
reality becomes folded to an
unbearable extent

The daemons

If they were just downright evil
There would be some will, even if it is a bad will,
It would calm
     down a little bit.
But there is nothing
Just automatisms and automatisms that induce other automatisms,
 
They can 
accumulate to something uncontrollable 
any time.
